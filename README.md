The provided Python script is designed to capture video from a webcam and recognize hand gestures using the MediaPipe library. It processes the video frames to detect hands and their landmarks. If two hands are detected, it displays a message on the screen. For a single hand, it identifies whether it’s the left or right hand.

For the left hand, it calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger tips. If this distance is greater than a certain threshold, it simulates a “volume up” key press; otherwise, it simulates a “volume down” key press using PyAutoGUI.

For the right hand, it also calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger tips but uses this distance to interpolate a screen brightness level between predefined minimum and maximum hand distances. It then sets the screen brightness to this level using the screen_brightness_control library.

The script continuously captures and processes frames until the ‘q’ key is pressed, which terminates the program.
